# Knife wall!
So you think you have the guts to withstand a game of knife wall do you? Well anty up, sharpen your blades, and keep your wits about you to see who will come out richer (and hopefully with all limbs still attached) .

<br/>

## Background

Knife wall is a mini game that can be played with a party size from 2 to as many as the game master will allow. If only one player character wishes to play the game master can use NPCs if they are present in the location, at the GM's discretion.

NPC's can be convinced to play through a skill check if they are not willing to play naturally. 

The intent of Knife Wall is not to hit or hurt the person on the wall but to try and scare them by throwing the knife as close to them without hitting them. The closer the throw (or higher the roll) competing against the save throw (or flinch) is what determines the outcome.

> #### Notes for Game Masters
> <br/> 
> This game is meant to be tense, as well as, boisterous in nature. It is ok to take some liberties with what you determine to be a super close throw versus a flinch respectively for a person on the wall versus a player throwing. 
> <br/>
> <br/>
> Players can "cheat". There is nothing in the rules about not using tricks, spells, magic, distractions, etc.
> Players can also add rules and/or agreements if they choose.
