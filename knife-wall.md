# Knife wall!
So you think you have the guts to withstand a game of knife wall do you? Well anty up, sharpen your blades, and keep your wits about you to see who will come out richer (and hopefully with all limbs still attached) .

<br/>

## Background

Knife wall is a mini game that can be played with a party size from 2 to as many as the game master will allow. If only one player character wishes to play the game master can use NPCs if they are present in the location, at the GM's discretion.

NPC's can be convinced to play through a skill check if they are not willing to play naturally. 

The intent of Knife Wall is not to hit or hurt the person on the wall but to try and scare them by throwing the knife as close to them without hitting them. The closer the throw (or higher the roll) competing against the save throw (or flinch) is what determines the outcome.

> "I made this mini-game as a result of my players wanting to get rowdy and burn off some of that murder hobo energy.

### Rules
* Each person makes a wager of either coin or value of equal value.
* Best of 3 rounds or an agreed upon length by the players and/or game master.
* To determine order each participant rolls 1d20 with no modifiers.
* Each player takes a turn throwing a knife at the person standing on the wall, as well as, taking a turn being on the wall. (See **Taking turns** for more information)
* A person throwing a knife makes a straight Dexterity Check (1d20 + Dexterity Modifier). 
* A person standing on the wall makes a Dexterity Saving Throw
* The outcome is determined by who rolls better or "competing" check v. save throws
* After a throw, players swap places with throwing or being on the wall.
* Tied rolls negate, no point is awarded to either player.
<br/><br/>

> #### Notes for Game Masters
> <br/> 
> This game is meant to be tense, as well as, boisterous in nature. It is ok to take some liberties with what you determine to be a super close throw versus a flinch respectively for a person on the wall versus a player throwing. 
> <br/>
> <br/>
> Players can "cheat". There is nothing in the rules about not using tricks, spells, magic, distractions, etc.
> Players can also add rules and/or agreements if they choose.

## How to start
Game Masters! Knife wall is not for the feint of heart or weak - it can break the strongers and largest of adventurers and make champions of the meek. It is a game 
<br/><br/>
The only prerequisite to knife wall is:
* A knife/dagger or equivalent.
* Some kind of wall or surface to stand against. 
* Players with loot or money to spend and play

<br/>
This is a really good opportunity as the game master to narrate what is going on in the surrounding environment and person(s) around. 

Have fun with it, the more excitement you introduce the higher the stakes can get. Maybe a fight breaks out between two NPCs as the game progresses because of the excitement.

<br/>

> *As the rogue and the fighter agree on their wager they hand over 50gp each to the barkeep for safe keeping as you see the bar explode with excitement. People running and gathering quickly spilling their drinks as they climb over one another. 'KNIFE WALLLL!' you hear yelled through the entirity of the bar.
> <br/><br/> 
> As you approach the wall across the bar you see it is pocked with holes, dents, and/or missing pieces of wood from previous games. Once positioned to start the barkeep approaches you both proclaiming loudly for all to hear:*
> <br/><br/>
>'You know the rules, I'll hold the gold until a winner prevails! Drinks 20% off while the game lasts!' * as the bar erupts in cheers and whistles.*
> <br/><br/>
> At this point both players roll 1d20 to see who goes first. Game on.
